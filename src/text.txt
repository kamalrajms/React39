## react intro

    What is React?

    1) React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces (UIs), especially Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    2) It helps developers build reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.

    Instead of reloading a whole webpage when something changes, React updates only the parts of the UI that need to change.

    -------
    Why do we need React?

	It makes UI development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

	Provides a better user experience with smooth updates without page reloads.


    ## must need to install node.js
 
## procedure to initiate project

    step 1 : npm create vite@latest [project_name]
    step 2 : select react
    step 3 : select javascript+swc
    step 4 : npm install                // install node module packages
    step 5 : npm run dev

    if you want to re-run your project mean 
        npm run dev

## Prop

    Props, is nothing but drilling data from praent component to child component.
    
        props decleration
        destructering of props

## Conditional rendering

    Conditional rendering means showing  or hiding parts on UI basde on some condition .

        Ternary operator     [condition?true:false ]
        Logical operator    &&  ||  !

##  useState() and Form

    Data that changes over time (e.g : uer input ,API Responses)
    Managed with the useState hook.

    syntex: const[state,setState]=useState(initiateValue)

        const[count,setCount]=useState(5)

    state--- the current value of the state variable
    setState-- a function that updat the state
    initiateValue--- the starting value of the state

## style in react 

    Global way styleing  --- app.css,index.css
    External way styleing--- External css file
    inline styleing---- style={{property:value}}
    Module way styleing--- must need to name  the file name as [fileName.module.css]
    Object Way styleing--- declearing a style in object


## useEffect()

    In react,useEffect is a hook that lets you perform side effect in functional component

    Side effect are task that happends  outside the narmal react rendering process  ..like:

            Fetching data from API 
            Updating the browser DOM manually
            Starting/stoping Timers

    
    syntex:

        useEffect(()=>{
            // code Logic....
        },[dependency 1,dependency 2....])

        if we oesn't mension any declearing mean it will only once.

        when ever the declearing gets an update ,that useEffect Logic is execute.

## Useref()

    Useref is a react hook that gives you a box (.current) you can store anything in
    like num,str,obj,function,.even DOM elements.

    That value persists between renders.

    Updating it does not cause your component to re-render.

    {current:value}

## useContext()

    Passing data from a parent component down to deeply nested child component is annoying.
    Normally,you'd have to pass props manually through eacch level(called Props drilling).
    useContext lets you to skip all the middle components and share data directly.

            Create a context
            Provide a value
            Consume the value

    we can able to use only one usecontext in a component...

## useReducer()

    syntex:
        const[state,dispatch]=useReducer(ReducerFunction,initialState)

    state--- current state (Like useState...)
    dispatch(action)---a function to tell reducer what to do.
    ReducerFunction(state,action)--- tha logic that return a new state
    initialState--- starting values.

## useId()

    useId() is a react Hook that creates a unique and stable ID for each component instance.


## Routing concept in react & Nested Ruting

    routing means navigation between pages in a web app without  refreshing the browser.
    In traditional website ,clicking a link reloads the whole page.
    In react (Single page Applications) , routing lets us changes the view without reloading.

        Better performance 
        Smooth user experiance
        Control over navigation without server request

    Commed: npm install react-router-dom

    structure:

        <BrowserRouter> 
        <Routes>
        <Route path="we need to add address apth for a component" element={<Home/>}/>
        <Route path="we need to add address apth for a component" element={<About/>}/>
        <Route path="we need to add address apth for a component" element={<contact/>}/>
        </Routes>
        </BrowserRouter>

        #  <BrowserRouter> 

            It is the main wrapper compponent for routing in react App.
            In enables navigation using the brouser URl in react app (history url)
            Without  , routing will not work.

        #  <Routes>

            It contains all the  <Route/> component.
            It tells react Router to which component to show at that time for which path.
            Only one route will match and Render at atime.
        
        # <Route/>

            Defines a specific UrL path and which component should load for that path.

## UseCallBack()

    Every time a component  re-Renders,
    It creates a brand-new copy of every function inside it.

    Even if the function's code looks exctaly the same,
    React sees it as  different it's a new Object in memory.

    Syntex:

        const name=UseCallBack(()=>{
            //code here
        },[dependency 1,dependency 2....])
